ChangeNotifierProvider listens for changes to a ChangeNotifier. Widgets below it can -access-> the state object -and- listen to state changes.

* changes to a ChangeNotifier is actually changes to the state object that the ChangeNotifier detected and informed notifyListerns about. 

He in turn then shares this information but only to the consumers registered with ChangeNotifierProvider

ChangeNotifierProvider creates an instance of providers listed inside its build context, these providers (see TabManager) can, for example, listen to tab index changes and notifies its listeners.
