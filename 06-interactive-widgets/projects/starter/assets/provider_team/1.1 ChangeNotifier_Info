ChangeNotifier is extended by a class to 
provide change notifications to its listeners.
This class that is extending ChangeNotifier allows [as the state object] change notifications to its listeners. It has that ability only because it is extending ChangeNotifier - she makes it possible through her notifyListeners method.

Bert's note: ChangeNotifier makes her method
" notifyListeners(); " available to the class
that is extending her to communicate the changes
to ChangeNotifierProvider registered listeners / consumers
